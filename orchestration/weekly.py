"""Weekly NFL refresh: bronze loaders, then dbt build.

From the repo root:

    uv run python -m orchestration.weekly
    uv run python -m orchestration.weekly 2024
    uv run python -m orchestration.weekly --serve

A plain run executes the flow once. ``--serve`` only listens for scheduled
runs, and the Tuesday schedule is created paused. Start
``uv run prefect server start`` in another terminal first if you want the UI.
